Stuff to add/fix for the next release of Virtual Jaguar
-------------------------------------------------------

- There are a few ROMs that use some "quasi-illegal" 68K instructions. Need
  to patch the 68K core to deal with these in a better way than they are
  now. [Shamus]
- Would be nice to have a GUI for things that are set on the command line or
  in the config file. [Shamus]
- Would also be nice to be able to dynamically change the keybindings for
  the various keys on the emulated Jaguar controller while inside the emulator.
  [Shamus]
- Code to stretch the display in a generic way would be nice. [Shamus]
- Blitter needs fixing. [Shamus]
- We need a comprehensive way of determining what gets written where and
  by whom (i.e., blitter wrote to range $F03000-$F03230) in order to figure
  out the remaining problems with various ROMs. [Shamus]
- There is a bug either with the GPU or the blitter (most likely the latter)
  which causes the spinning "A"s in the BIOS startup code to be corrupted
  when they are showing their backsides. [Shamus]


Stuff that was added/fixed
--------------------------

- DSP code needs to be rewritten. [Shamus] [DONE but still work to be done--Shamus]
- We need to have an external configuration file for remembering a user's
  preferences, such as key bindings, etc. [Shamus] [DONE--Shamus]
- We need to come up with a way to fix the aspect ratio for pixel modes that
  aren't square (PWIDTH != 4). [Shamus] [DONE for OpenGL--Shamus]
- GUI for ROM selection [Shamus] [DONE--Shamus]
- Need to rewrite the main Jaguar execution loop to increment the VC by one
  instead of by two, which is how the real Jaguar works. [Shamus] [DONE--Shamus]
- Sound needs a rewrite. With SDL, this shouldn't be much of a problem.
  Of course, whoever does this should realize that the PCM outs are probably
  not being used for a majority of the ROMs out there--according to the JTRM,
  you're supposed to use the I2S interface to output sound since the PCM outs
  aren't even physically hooked up in the console! [Shamus] [DONE--Shamus]
