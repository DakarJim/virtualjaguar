Virtual Jaguar v1.0.4 GCC/SDL - source only release
---------------------------------------------------

* Lots of bugfixes. [Shamus]
* Jaguar BIOS now works properly and is used by default. BIOS failure was
  due to a bug in the GPU (specifically in the SUBC and ADDC opcodes). To
  override this behavior, use the -nobios switch. [Shamus]
* Rewrote the OP code--mostly because it was pissing me off. ;-) Not
  to mention that it was almost completely unmaintainable in its former
  state and was just plain wrong in its implementation in many places.
  Because of this, some RMW effects that were missing from AvP are present
  now and leftover crud in scaled bitmaps in Rayman is gone now. ;-) [Shamus]
* ZIP support! Now there is no longer any need to unzip ROMs (although if
  you prefer to waste HD space, VJ will gladly accomodate you). The code to
  support this is a pretty ugly hack, but it works and there are other fish
  to fry at the moment. Also, ZLIB is now required to compile VJ. [Shamus]
* Support for PD ROMs. Currently the only one that works at all is JagMania,
  though as the hardware emulation gets better more PD ROMs will begin to
  work. Note that you must use the -nobios switch for this to work. [Shamus]
* Preliminary support for PAL Jaguar emulation. Default is NTSC. To use it,
  use the -pal switch. [Shamus]
* Support for DSP activation. The DSP is now *off* by default, since it
  doesn't work properly yet. Use the -dspon switch to force the DSP on.
  [Shamus]
* Removed all hacks that were written to support a specific ROM from the OP
  and GPU code (much more remains to be removed). Since the CRCs that were
  calculated to support these hacks were done on byte swapped ROMs, they
  weren't working anyway. Besides which, a hack means that you don't
  understand the hardware properly and/or don't know how to write the code to
  properly emulate the hardware. ;-) [Shamus]
* Renamed the executable from the ridiculously named jag_em to the more
  sensibly named vj. Note that the Jag_em.cpp file has also been changed to
  reflect this name change. [Shamus]
* Removed Aaron Giles 68K dissasembler in favor of the one included with the
  Musashi core. It's there, why not use it? ;-) [Shamus]
* Reordered the order of A, B, and C buttons to more accurately reflect their
  respective positions on a real Jaguar controller. Also fixed a small bug that
  kept the number pad from reporting the right numbers to the emulator. :-)
  [Shamus]
* Started to remove the !__PORT__ defintions from the source code. Since this
  is supposed to be a portable emulator, we won't be using any MS specific
  code anyway. [Shamus]
* Fixed some problems with the blitter when doing clipping and bit expansion.
  Also fixed (reintroduced?) a bug that existed in the real blitter HW (the
  YADD1 bit in A2--fixes Tempest 2000). [Shamus]
* Probably a bunch of other stuff that I've forgotten about. ;-) [Shamus]

NOTE: Tested only on WIN32 platform! ;-)


Virtual Jaguar v1.0.3 GCC/SDL - source only release
---------------------------------------------------

* Converted GNU assembly in the GPU core to C code -- Rayman and
  Alien vs Predator work again. :-) [Shamus]
* Removed closed source Starscream and replaced it with the open source
  Musashi core. Because of this, VJ runs a little faster now. :-) [Shamus]
* Various cleanups to the source files (still lots of work to do!) [Shamus]

NOTE: Tested only on WIN32 platform!


1.0.1 - 1.0.2 - Unreleased, mostly for testing/finding bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------


Virtual Jaguar v1.0.0 GCC/SDL - initial source release
------------------------------------------------------

* Converted VC++ assembly to standard GNU assembly;
* Fixed small bugs in SDL related items (keyboard/graphics);
* Added *some* optimalisations to the graphics sources;
* Added joystick support (not tested);
* Added joystick port support (not tested);
* Added frameskip support;

Source only release. Tested on BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32.
SOUND emulation was NOT done. Need help with this one :)
