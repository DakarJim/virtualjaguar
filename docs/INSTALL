---------------------------------------------
Virtual Jaguar v1.1.0 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
---------------------------------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The minimum requirements for compiling Virtual Jaguar from source are:

 o  GCC v4.3.x or higher
 o  SDL v1.2.13 or higher
 o  zlib v1.2.3
 o  libcdio v0.80 or higher
 o  OpenGL libraries
 o  supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw, MacOS); other
    OSs may work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile.

Optionally you'll need an Atari Jaguar boot ROM (and/or CD boot ROM) which is
available on the Internet. We can't include the boot ROM since it's still
copyrighted.


COMPILING:
----------

Assuming that you meet the minimum software requirements, you can compile
Virtual Jaguar by issuing the following command in the directory where you
decompressed the source:

make

Optionally you can manually strip vj[.exe] to downsize the binary. If you have
upx in your path somewhere, you can uncomment the line in the makefile that
executes upx so that you'll end up with a somewhat smaller binary.

That's it! You can now start the emulator with ./vj. See the output for more
details (or stdout.txt on Win32) or consult the README file for more info.
