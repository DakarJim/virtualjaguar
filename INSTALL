Virtual Jaguar v1.0.6 GCC/SDL release INSTALL
---------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:

To compile Virtual Jaguar you need to check if you have the minimum
requirements for compiling the sources:

- GCC v2.95 or v3.x;
- SDL v1.2.5 or higher;
- ZLIB v1.1.4
- OpenGL libraries
- supported OS (BeOS, Linux, FreeBSD and WIN32 through mingw); other OSs may
  work to but you may need to change some items in the Makefile(s).

Optionally you need a Atari Jaguar (CD) boot ROM which is available on the
Internet. We can't include the boot ROM since it's still copyrighted.

Also, I would recommend that you have at least 20MB of free space. The .o's
can be quite big and the binary is likely to be about a 1.5MB in size (with
UPX or strip this could downsize to about 800K).

COMPILING:

If you sure you have the minimum software requirements, you can safely
compile Virtual Jaguar v1.0.6 GCC/SDL release by doing the following:

1) Compile:

   make -f Makefile.win32 (for WIN32 systems with mingw)
   make -f Makefile.unix  (for UN*X  systems with gcc)

2) Optionally you can manually strip vj[.exe] to downsize the binary.

If you have upx in your path somewhere, you can uncomment the line in the
makefile that executes upx so that you'll end up with a somewhat smaller
binary.
 
That's it! You're done! You can now start the emulator with ./vj.
